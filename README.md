# PenguinPay üêß

You work for an imaginary money transmitter, PenguinPay.
Penguin pay sends money from the US (the sending market) to several countries in Africa (the receiving markets),
where it pays out to different delivery networks such as M-Pesa in Kenya and MTN in Uganda. As part of PenguinPay‚Äôs growth
strategy they are looking to launch a new sending market, the (fictitious) country of Binaria.
Binaria is home to multiple diaspora who are eager to send money to their friends and families back in their home countries.
Binaria has one main requirement for remitting money, one which PenguinPay will need to take into account in their app: residents of Binaria are only allowed to use binary numbers.
For example, where in the US a user would enter `22` if they wished to send `$22`, in Binaria they must enter ‚Äú010110‚Äù. If a resident of Binaria wishes to see how much money in local currency the recipient will receive, it too must be displayed in binary. For example, entering ‚Äò010110‚Äô for a recipient in Nigeria should show `01111100010001` (`$22` converted to NGN at current exchange rate of `1 USD = 361.50 NGN`). Binaria has pegged its currency to the US Dollar.

Your job is to design a prototype of the ‚ÄòSend Transactions‚Äô screen for PenguinPay‚Äôs upcoming launch. The PenguinPay Product Manager has given you the following requirement:
1. Allow the user to enter the first and last name of a recipient
2. Allow the user to enter the phone number of the recipient
3. Either the user should be able to select the recipient's country and the phone number
should be validated based on it OR the country should be determined based on the phone number entered. Only phone numbers Kenya, Nigeria, Tanzania, or Uganda should be allowed.
4. Allow the user to enter the amount they wish to send in binary numbers
5. Display to the user the amount the recipient will receive in binary numbers with the
appropriate local currency indicated.
6. Allow the user to press send, at which point an appropriate message should be given to
the user that their transaction is being sent.
7. The amount the recipient will receive should be converted from Binarian Dollars to local
currency at current market rates. As Binarian Dollars are pegged to US Dollars, you can use US Dollar (USD) exchange rates.
8. Current exchange rates can be accessed via APIs from `openexchangerates.org` (free plan) using the `latest.json` endpoint (the other endpoints are not available on the free plan)

## How to run the project

 1. Download the project
 2. Navigate to the project from terminal and run 
 ```swift
 make setup
 ```
 3. While installing `Cocoapods` you'll be asked for `openexchangerates` AppId, please enter yours or use this for testing purposes, `d367f022b0a24af092ba471aa4187a83`.
 4. Open the project with Xcode
 5. Run the project
 6. Check the Emulator or your real device

## The App Architecture

 1. VIP Architecture pattern
 
 ## Libraries
 
 1. Alamofire for networking and network reachability
 2. Cocoapods-Keys for saving keys
